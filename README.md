# zsig OS

A small hobby OS made

## Inspiration

Inspired by [the little book about OS development](https://littleosbook.github.io), [this document](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf)
and the [OSDev wiki](http://wiki.osdev.org/). After a few difficulties the [os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial) was also very helpful.
